## **How to play**

### **Singleplayer**

Work In Progress

### **Multiplayer**

Open two tabs to simulate two players.

Go to the multiplayer page as both players.

Create a room with a player and join it with the other.

Place down your ships by clicking on the grid boxes, until there are 17.

When both players are ready a random player will be the first to start.

He will get to click on a box and see if there is a ship there (red) or not (blue).

The players will take turns guessing where there is a ship.

When a player sinks all of the enemy's ships, the game ends.
